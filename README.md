## Databases-project-template 

In this project I used a relational database to create the initial data structure for a vet clinic. It is possible to create a table to store animals' information, insert some data into it, and query it.

## Getting Started
This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

Use <a href="https://github.com/ivaan1992/vet-clinic/blob/feat/create_table/schema.sql">schema.sql</a> to
create all tables.

Use <a href="https://github.com/ivaan1992/vet-clinic/blob/feat/create_table/data.sql">data.sql</a> to populate tables with sample data.

Check <a href="https://github.com/ivaan1992/vet-clinic/blob/feat/create_table/queries.sql">
queries.sql
</a>for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!
